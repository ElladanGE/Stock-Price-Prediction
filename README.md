# Stock-Price-Prediction
Predicting next day Stock Close price using Machine Learning. I have implemented this project using Jupyter Notebook and Python. Libraries used were sklearn, Tensorflow, Numpy, matplotlip and seaborn.

I have used an MLP Regressor, an LSTM Recursive Neural Network and a simple Artifical Neural Network. Analysis was performed on the Swiss Stock Exchange Index (SSMI). I looked at how and if technical indicators can increase predictive accuracy of next day stock closing price.
